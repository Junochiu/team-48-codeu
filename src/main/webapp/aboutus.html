    <li>intro:
        So lucky to join this program and meet you guys!! I'm Sinyu Huang from Kaohsiung and now a sophomore studying
        electrical engineering in National Cheng Kong University.

        <ol>
            <li>Stock marketing: I was a member in stock studying club last year. We invite lecturers and discuss about
                financial big news happening in weeks. I have interest in studying options which is a financial product
                . I don't operate stocks ,since I'm just a collage student without lots of money.haha~ However, always
                welcome everybody to discuss stocks with me!!
            </li>
            <li>Cartoon Lover: Disney movies such as minions, Toy story, Wreck-It Ralph are my favorite. There are rare
                collage students go to theater watching cartoon, but I won't be absent in any disney movie. By the way,
                Aladdin will be released next week, but I have an important
                midterm exam. That's miserable.
            </li>
            <li>Love making friends: I'm the volunteer who helps international students in our school. I think that's a
                meaningful jobs which really helps people really needs. Since I'm a outgoing person and won't be nervous
                when talking strangers. The job really fits my personality.
