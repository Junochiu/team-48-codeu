          . I don't operate stocks ,since I'm just a collage student without lots of money.haha~ However, always welcome everybody to discuss stocks with me!! </li>
          <li>Cartoon Lover: Disney movies such as minions, Toy story, Wreck-It Ralph are my favorite. There are rare collage students go to theater watching cartoon, but I won't be absent in any disney movie. By the way, Aladdin will be released next week, but I have an important
          midterm exam. That's miserable.</li>
